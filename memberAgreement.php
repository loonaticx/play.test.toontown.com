<p>
<p>DISCLAIMER
<p>
<p>THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, DISNEY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. YOU (AND NOT DISNEY) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<p>
<p>WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, AS A SERVICE TO USERS OF THE DISNEY SERVICE, WE INCLUDE LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB PORTION OF THE INTERNET AND THAT DISNEY HAS NO CONTROL OVER, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, REGARDING THE CONTENT OR APPROPRIATENESS OF CONTENT ON SUCH WEB SITES, AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST US WITH RESPECT TO SUCH WEB SITES.
<p>
<p>Further, Disney explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy, content, or availability of information found on sites that link to or from Disney's Toontown Online from third parties not associated with Disney. Disney encourages discretion when browsing the Internet using our or anyone else's service. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, Disney cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. Disney cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from Disney's Toontown Online since other shop channels are owned and operated by independent retailers.  Disney does not endorse any of the merchandise, nor has Disney taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained in such third-party sites.

We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
<p>
<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
<p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL DISNEY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE OR ANY OTHER WEB SITE, EVEN IF DISNEY OR A DISNEY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL DISNEY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THE SERVICE.
<p>
<p>SECURITY
<p>
<p>As part of the registration process, Members will select a password, parent password and member name ("Member Name"). You shall provide Disney with accurate, complete, and updated Account information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your Account. You may not (i) select or use a Member Name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use a name subject to the rights of any other person without authorization; or (iii) use a Member Name that Disney, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate or offensive.
<p>
<p>You shall notify Disney by e-mail at toontown@disneyonline.com of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or parent password. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and parent password.
<p>
<p>Each Parent Account must be 18 years or older to establish an Account. If Disney becomes aware that a Parent Account is under the age of 18, Disney reserves the right to cancel the Account.
<p>
<p>Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your Account, at Disney's sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.
<p>
<p>PRICE AND PAYMENT
<p>
<p>Disney reserves the right at any time to charge additional fees for access to the Service. Disney reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the Service, and to institute new fees or charges effective upon prior notice to Members.  Disney reserves the right to provide the Service at no charge for promotional reasons or otherwise (such as a free trial).
<p>
<p>Each Parent Account agrees to pay all charges to the Parent's Account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. Parent Accounts must provide Disney with valid credit card information as requested during the registration process. Disney shall charge the Parent Account's credit card on the date Parent Account subscribes to the Service. Thereafter, Disney will automatically renew and charge the Parent's Account as follows:
<p>
<p>-Each month for the following month's service for monthly subscriptions
<p>
<p>-Upon every three(3)-month anniversary of the first billing date for quarterly subscriptions
<p>
<p>-Upon every six(6)-month anniversary of the first billing date for semiannual subscriptions
<p>
<p>-Upon every one(1)-year anniversary of the first billing date for annual subscriptions
<p>
<p>The renewal charge shall be equal to or less than the original subscription price, unless otherwise notified in advance by Disney. You may notify Disney that you wish to cancel your subscription at any time.  Disney agrees that it will terminate your Account upon receipt of notification from the Parent Account, as described below.
<p>
<p>For monthly subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 15 days following the first day of the initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. Your access to the game will be canceled immediately.
<p>
<p>For quarterly subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days following the first day of the initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 30 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>
<p>For semiannual subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days following the first day of initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 30 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>
<p>For annual subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days following the first day of initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 30 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>
<p>Your right to use the Service is subject to any limits established by Disney or by your credit card issuer. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your charge is returned to Disney for any reason, including chargeback, Disney reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access and Account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of Disney hereunder.
<p>
<p>If you have a balance due on any Disney Account, you agree that Disney can charge these unpaid fees to your credit card. Disney reserves the right to establish a credit limit (the "Ceiling") for each Member. If a Member's Account reaches the Ceiling at any time, Disney may immediately bill the Member's credit card for all unpaid charges on account. Until further notice, the Ceiling for each Member is $100.
<p>
<p>If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Member Name, Password, or any credit, debit, or charge card number stored on the Service), you must promptly change your Password and notify Disney of the problem (by notice given as described in the Notice section below) to avoid possible liability for any unauthorized charges to your Account.
<p>
<p>PARENTAL CONSENT
<p>
<p>Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), parental consent is required for the online collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information obtained from a child under the age of 13.  As part of the registration process for the Service, the Parent Account will be asked to provide a valid credit card.  Parents and legal guardians, you will be allowed to create up to six Toons (a Toon is a character you create and use to play the game in the Service), all will be under the Parent Account.  Kids will need to have a parent or legal guardian register as the Parent Account holder and then they can create their own Toon within the Parent Account.  By providing his or her credit card number, the Parent Account holder: (a) represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of any child under the age of 13 for whom he or she allows to use the Parent Account; and (b) agrees to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy [http://disney.go.com/corporate/legal/wdig_privacy.html] with respect to any child under the age of 13 for whom the Parent Account holder allows to use the Parent Account.
<p>
<p>The Service includes an interactive feature we call Open Chat with True Friends. The Parent Account will be given the opportunity to disable the Open Chat with True Friends feature once he or she is inside the Service. Open Chat with True Friends allows one member to chat with another member only by means of a secret code that must be communicated outside of the game. Open Chat with True Friends may be moderated, and Disney reserves the right to moderate any part of the Service that Disney, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary. However, because Open Chat with True Friends will not always be moderated, if the Parent Account allows a child to use his or her account with the Open Chat with True Friends feature enabled, we strongly encourage parents to supervise their child or children while they play in the Service. By enabling the Open Chat with True Friends feature, the Parent Account acknowledges that there are some risks inherent in the Open Chat with True Friends feature and that the Parent Account has been informed of, and agrees to accept, any such risks, whether foreseeable or otherwise. You will be given the opportunity to learn more about the Open Chat with True Friends feature, and the chance to enable it, once you are inside the Service.
<p>
<p>NOTICE
<p>
<p>The Parent Account will submit and maintain a correct e-mail address and other Account information. We may give notice to the Parent Account by means of a general notice on the Service, electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in our Account information, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to your address on record in our Account information. You may give notice to Disney. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Disney at any time by e-mail at toontown@disneyonline.com.
<p>
<p>NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF MEMBERSHIP
<p>
<p>Disney grants to you a personal, nonexclusive, nonassignable, and non-transferable license to use and display the Disney Software on any machine(s) of which you are the primary user.

<p>SUBMISSIONS
<p>
<p>We are pleased to hear from our Members and welcome your comments regarding Disney's Toontown Online and other Disney products. Unfortunately, however, Disney's company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those we have specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as stories or character ideas, screenplays, or original artwork unless we have specifically requested that you do so. While we do value your feedback on our Service and products, we request that you be specific in your comments, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials.
<p>
<p>If at our request you send certain specific submissions (e.g., contests) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of Disney. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Disney, and Disney shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, Disney shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.

<p>SECURITY
<p>

You shall provide Disney with accurate, complete, and updated Account information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your Account.

<p>
<p>You shall notify Disney by e-mail at toontown@online.disney.com of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or parent password. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and parent password.
<p>Each Parent Account must be 18 years or older to establish an Account. If Disney becomes aware that a Parent Account is under the age of 18, Disney reserves the right to cancel the Account.
<p>
<p>Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your Account, at Disney's sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.
<p>
<p>PRICE AND PAYMENT
<p>
<p>Disney reserves the right at any time to charge additional fees for access to the Service. Disney reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the Service, and to institute new fees or charges effective upon prior notice to Members.  Disney reserves the right to provide the Service at no charge for promotional reasons or otherwise (such as a free trial).
<p>
<p>By activating your Card you are entitled to receive the Disney's Toontown Online - AT&T Web Cents Card version of the Service at no additional cost for the period of time set forth on your Card.  When your Card expires you may purchase and use another Card to receive further access to the Service or, at anytime, you may register for the Service and become a full-fledged member of Disney's Toontown Online.
<p>
<p>Our refund policy for the Cards is as follows:  Cards are subject to the policy of the store where you purchased the Card.  Subject to the store's refund policy, the store will issue you a refund.  Once the pin code on the Card has been scratched off you will not be entitled to receive a refund.  Once you have entered the Card's serial number and pin code online you will not be entitled to receive a refund.
<p>
<p>Should you decide to register for the Service and become a full-fledged member of Disney's Toontown Online, the following price and payment information will apply to you.
<p>
<p>Each Parent Account agrees to pay all charges to the Parent&#39;s Account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. Parent Accounts must provide Disney with valid credit card information as requested during the registration process. Disney shall charge the Parent Account's credit card on the date Parent Account subscribes to the Service. Thereafter, Disney will automatically renew and charge the Parent's Account as follows:
<p>
<p>- Each month for the following month's service for monthly subscriptions
<p>- Upon every six(6)-month anniversary of the first billing date for semiannual subscriptions
<p>- Upon every one(1)-year anniversary of the first billing date for annual subscriptions
<p>
<p>The renewal charge shall be equal to or less than the original subscription price, unless otherwise notified in advance by Disney. You may notify Disney that you wish to cancel your subscription at any time.  Disney agrees that it will terminate your Account upon receipt of notification from the Parent Account, as described below.
<p>
<p>- For monthly subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 5 days following the first day of the initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 5 days after the initial billing, your Account will be canceled as of the end of the current billing period and no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>- For semiannual subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 15 days following the first day of initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 15 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>- For annual subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days following the first day of initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 30 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.
<p>
<p>Your right to use the Service is subject to any limits established by Disney or by your credit card issuer. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your charge is returned to Disney for any reason, including chargeback, Disney reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access and Account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of Disney hereunder.  If you have a balance due on any Disney Account, you agree that Disney can charge these unpaid fees to your credit card. Disney reserves the right to establish a credit limit (the "Ceiling") for each Member. If a Member's Account reaches the Ceiling at any time, Disney may immediately bill the Member's credit card for all unpaid charges on account. Until further notice, the Ceiling for each Member is $100.
<p>
<p>If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Member Name, Password, or any credit, debit, or charge card number stored on the Service), you must promptly change your Password and notify Disney of the problem (by notice given as described in the Notice section below) to avoid possible liability for any unauthorized charges to your Account.
<p>
<p>PRIVACY AND PARENTAL CONSENT
<p>
<p>We will abide by our Privacy Policy [http://disney.go.com/corporate/legal/wdig_privacy.html] with regard to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.  We cannot promise that the information you provide, including your personal information, will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may disclose information as required in the course of normal operation and maintenance of the Service and its systems or if required to do so by law or in our good faith we believe that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Disney; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Disney; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our Members or the public.  Also, third parties may, without our knowledge or consent, unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Service, you hereby grant us permission to (i) upload game file information from the Disney directory and (ii) download game file information to you.
<p>
<p>Like other Web sties directed to children, Disney's Toontown Online is required by law to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").   Under COPPA, parental consent is required for the online collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information obtained from a child under the age of 13.  Before we collect, use and/or disclose any personal information from a child, we will obtain consent from the Parent Account. As part of the registration process for the Service, the Parent Account will be asked to provide a valid credit card.  Parents and legal guardians, you will be allowed to create up to six Toons (a Toon is a character you create and use to play the game in the Service), all will be under the Parent Account.  Kids will need to have a parent or legal guardian register as the Parent Account holder and then they can create their own Toon within the Parent Account.  By providing his or her credit card number, the Parent Account holder: (a) represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of any child under the age of 13 for whom he or she allows to use the Parent Account; and (b) agrees to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy [http://disney.go.com/legal/privacy_policy.html] with respect to any child under the age of 13 for whom the Parent Account holder allows to use the Parent Account.
<p>
<p>The Service includes an interactive feature we call Open Chat with True Friends. The Parent Account will be given the opportunity to disable the Open Chat with True Friends feature once he or she is inside the Service. Open Chat with True Friends allows one member to chat with another member only by means of a secret code that must be communicated outside of the game. Open Chat with True Friends may be moderated, and Disney reserves the right to moderate any part of the Service that Disney, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary. However, because Open Chat with True Friends will not always be moderated, if the Parent Account allows a child to use his or her account with the Open Chat with True Friends feature enabled, we strongly encourage parents to supervise their child or children while they play in the Service. By enabling the Open Chat with True Friends feature, the Parent Account acknowledges that there are some risks inherent in the Open Chat with True Friends feature and that the Parent Account has been informed of, and agrees to accept, any such risks, whether foreseeable or otherwise. You will be given the opportunity to learn more about the Open Chat with True Friends feature, and the chance to enable it, once you are inside the Service.
<p>
<p>NOTICE
<p>
<p>The Parent Account will submit and maintain a correct e-mail address and other Account information. We may give notice to the Parent Account by means of a general notice on the Service, electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in our Account information, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to your address on record in our Account information. You may give notice to Disney. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Disney at any time by e-mail at toontown@online.disney.com.
<p>
