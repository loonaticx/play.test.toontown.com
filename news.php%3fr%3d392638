<b>ATTENTION TEST Toons</b>: Some of your Toons may be temporarily inaccessible, but don't panic! 
<br><br>
We are testing some new Toontown Trial account features and some Toontown Test accounts have been temporarily set to a special Trial account status -- If you've had Toons in both the top and bottom-middle slots, then you will have access to both (the middle column) during these tests.  If you did not have a Toon in the bottom-middle slot then you will only have access to the top-middle one (1) Toon during these tests.
<br><br>
<b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: The five (5) remaining Toon slots of these accounts will be unaffected and temporarily unavailable during these tests. After a period of time accounts that have been set to the special Trial status will revert to normal and all your Toons will be accessible once more. During this test period all Toons will take turns having their account set to this new Trial status, so don't be surprised if it's your turn! 
<br><br>
If your account is in this special Trial one (1) Toon status, you will have: 
<ul>
<li>Access to Toontown Central.
<li>Access only to Toontown Central ToonTasks.
<li>Limited Goofy Speedway access.
<li>Access to your Estate.
<li>Limited Access to the other Neighborhoods and Cog HQs (you can only participate in street battles).
</ul>
Test accounts that are in this Trial one (1) Toon status will only remain this way for a short period of time, so please jump right in and play thru all aspects of Toontown. Also, if your account has been made into a Test Trial account and you have an open top-middle slot, please create and play a new Toon. 
<br><br>
Be sure to report any issues you encounter via our Report a Problem page! The Toon Council thanks you for your assistance!

- Limited Goofy Speedway access.<br>
- Access to your Estate.<br>

Also, if your account has been made into a Test Trial account and you have an open middle slot, please create and play a new Toon.

<b>March 16, 2007 [sv1.0.26.1.test]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Attention TEST Toons!</b>  Grab some friends and head to your nearest Trolley Station to check out four new TOONtastic Trolley Games!  And between 12:00pm and 6:00pm, a new Trolley Holiday will take place where you and your friends can cast secret votes to determine which game the Trolley takes you to next, while possibly earning bonus Jellybeans to boot!
<ul>
Details of the Travel Game during Trolley Holiday:
<li>There are four (4) new Trolley Games, tentatively named: Diving Game, Pairing Game, Target Game, and Vine Game.
<li>During the Trolley Holiday, the Travel Game is played along with a set number of Trolley Games, with the Travel Game first followed by a Trolley Game etc... for a total of six (6) rounds.
<li>Use votes to help control the Trolley towards a particular Trolley Game destination.  Unused votes will be converted into Jellybeans at the end of the game, but you will earn a lot more by trying to steer the Trolley towards your secret goal which will net you lots of Jellybeans!  Don't get out-voted by others!
<li>After each Trolley Game the Jellybeans you earn will be converted into more votes for use to help control the Trolley.  At the end of the Travel Game, unused votes will be multiplied by a number for a total number of Jellybeans earned.  The size of the multiplier and number of bonus Jellybeans at your secret goal is determined by the number of Toons playing in each session.
</ul>
Other notes on the new Trolley Games:
<ul>
<li>In the multiplayer version of the Pairing Game, each Toon can only flip over one card at a time so you must work together to find matches.
<li>In the Diving Game, use the "UP" arrow key to move your Toon <u>towards</u> the direction he or she is pointed.  The "DOWN" arrow key does not make your Toon dive!  Use the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" arrow keys to turn your Toon towards the bottom of the ocean and use the "UP" arrow to dive deeper.
<li>In the Target Game, make sure to keep steering your Toon with the arrow keys after you've opened your umbrella for that perfect landing!
<li><b>*** KNOWN ISSUES***</b>  In the Vine Game, the vines have a graphics problem that makes them look very odd.  Also when the time runs out it takes a while for the game to transition to the Jellybean award screen, please be patient as the game is not locked up/frozen.  We will fix these issues with the Vine Game upon next release.
<li><b>*** KNOWN ISSUE ***</b>  Currently when you enter your house on your Estate you will crash.  Please refrain from going into your house and instead play lots of Trolley Games!  We will fix this problem on the next release.
</ul>
<b>*** Mac Toons Please Note ***</b>
<br><br>
The new update is currently not available for our Mac Toons.  We sincerely apologize and appreciate your understanding and patience.  We are working as fast as we can to make the Mac client for this update available upon next release.
