    <strong><font color="#CE0202">What is AT&T Web Cents?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Disney's Toontown Online has partnered with AT&T Web Cents as a way of offering Guests a credit card free, narrowband-friendly way to enjoy the benefits of Toontown.  For more information on this secure payment method, visit <a href="javascript:popWin2('http://www.consumer.att.com/prepaidcard/webcents/')">http://www.consumer.att.com/prepaidcard/webcents/</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">How do I activate my card?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Your Game Card will not work until activated by a cashier. At checkout, your card will be automatically activated. After that, you can log on to your computer whenever you please, enter your Serial Number and PIN codes, and begin your membership. Your membership will not begin until you create an account online.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">My card is not activated, what do I do?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Please contact the retailer where you purchased your card since cards are activated on-site at the retail locations.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">Will I be charged any fees for using the Membership Card?</font></strong>
    <br>
    No. The only charge to the card is for the initial purchase at the store.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">Can I purchase a Membership Card online?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Currently, the Membership Cards are not available for purchase online.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">Will my credit card be charged automatically?</font></strong>
    <br>
    No, we will never charge you without your consent. To start your membership, we do not require that you give us your credit card number. If you choose to continue your membership, you can then use your credit card to extend your membership.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">What's included with my purchase of a Disney's Toontown Online Game Card?</font></strong>
    <br>
    With a Disney's Toontown Online Game Card, you are entitled to enjoy the biggest, ever-expanding, massively multiplayer, pie-throwin', piano-dropping, totally Toontastic, online game ever!

    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">How do I continue my membership when my game card expires?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Click the "Update Subscription" button on the front page of the Toontown Web site.  From here you can log in to your account and enter a new game card.  You can also choose from several other cost-saving membership plans.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">I'm a current member of Toontown on a monthly, semi-annual or annual credit card plan.  Can I apply a game card to my current subscription?</font></strong>
    <br>
    Yes!  Just click on the "Update Subscription" button on the front page of the Toontown Web site.  From here you can log in to your account and enter your game card information.  The game card's time will be added to your account to extend your subscription.  When the amount of time on the card expires, you will automatically be moved back to having your credit card billed for your account -- just as usual. You can apply another card at any time.
    <br><br>
    <strong><font color="#CE0202">How do I get my Toontown Welcome Kit and Monthly Mailers?</font></strong>
    <br>
    To send you these additional member benefits we need a little added information and a credit card number to verify age.  Click the "Update Account" button on the "Thanks For Playing" page to enter the added information.  If you are under 18, make sure to ask Mom or Dad for help, as we need their permission.  The Welcome Kit comes straight from the Toontown Council and includes a letter from Flippy, stickers, and a cool Cog Poster.  The monthly mailer includes a Toontown newsletter and limited-edition trading cards.  Both of these are free as long as you maintain your Toontown membership.
