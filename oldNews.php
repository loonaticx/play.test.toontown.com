<li>Fixed a bug that awarded an excessive amount merits and/or item recoveries in any multi-stage battle (i.e. buildings, factories, mints).  Now the number of merits received will be increased by the same multiplier used for the gag skill credit.
<p>For example, merits recovered on the third floor of a building will be multiplied by a factor of two.  The result is that in most cases the number of merits gained after the bug fix is comparable to before the fix.  Item recovery rates have not been adjusted.

<p><b>Cashbot HQ preview!</b>
<p>Here's a preview of what every Cog bustin' Toon has been waiting for.
<ul>
<li>You can reach Cashbot HQ via the entrance at the end of Pajama Place.
<li>Currently you can play in the <b>Train Yard</b> and the <b>Mint</b>.
<li>At this busy freight yard, you should only be able to cross the tracks via the red pedestrian bridges. If hit by a train you will be damaged and flattened temporarily (a la the stompers). Watch out for roaming Cogs while on your way to the elevators.
<li>The three elevators take you to various floors in a Mint. Each floor consists of a "random" combination of rooms. Some may be puzzle rooms with stompers, conveyors, and crates (like the factory), others may have barrels of gags, and some will have cog battles in them.
<li>There are three mints (coin/dollar/bullion) and each one has 20 floors, for a total of 60 mint floors. When you go into a mint elevator, you attempt to conquer a single floor.
<p>Each mint floor is made up of a sequence of rooms, and the rooms are pulled from a shared pool of 25 total unique rooms. That means that a particular room (i.e. the room with a big gear on the floor.) will show up on multiple floors, but you will never see the same room more than once on a single floor.
</ul>
<b>*** NOTE ***</b>
<ul>
<li>There are a few rooms in some Mint floors that are rather empty at the moment.  They will have more features added at a later date.
<li>Please be sure to note the Mint Floor number when you report a bug associated with the Mint.  Taking a screenshot will automatically show the floor number and roomID so that would be the best way to report any bugs.

<p><b>December 1, 2003 [sv1.0.9.2.test]</b>
<h5>Welcome!</h5>

<p>Welcome to the initial prototype testing of Cog Headquarters (Cog HQ). The first Cog HQ released will be the Sellbot HQ, attached to Daisy Gardens. We are excited to be in the final development stages of this new area of Toontown -- but we have a long way to go, and we are ready for your help! Cog HQ introduces new physics, environments, enemies, story elements, and game play and thus needs great deal of testing. We feel it is close enough to start letting people in to this rough version.

<p>A few things to keep in mind, especially for those new to the test server: 

<ul>
<li>Nothing of what you will see should be considered final. 
<li>Balancing will change. Every system may get easier, or harder, and may change several times. 
<li>Story elements may be tweaked and rearranged for clarity.
<li>Very little is polished - The interface, sounds, physics, and dialog will all get better over time before final release. 
<li>Temporary sound effects - We will integrate final background music and sound effects soon. 
<li>Lots of cracks or holes in world - Take screenshots and report. We are still updating all the 3D models to the new physics system. 
<li>No CogHQ ToonTasks yet - These will be added over time as we finalize the overall difficulty. 
<li>Textures, models, and code are not optimized - Your graphics rendering (frame rate) may be choppier than in other areas of Toontown.  The game will be smooth at times and completely unplayable at other times. Please bear with us. 
<li>We may not directly respond to each individual bug report, especially if we get numerous copies of the same issue. But rest assured, each and every report is read by developers. 
</ul>

<p>A Brief CogHQ Overview</p>

<p>Toons have been taken hostage by the Cogs! They are being held on the top floor of CogHQ. It is your mission to gang up and rescue them. Getting into CogHQ will not be easy though; their tight security will detect and reject any Toons that enter. You must build a Cog disguise first by recovering Cog parts from their factory. The factory is a 4-player environment with many new game-play elements. You can keep track of your Cog disguise progress with a new page in your Shticker Book. 

<p>Once you have your entire Cog disguise built you can enter the Cog HQ lobby dressed as a Cog. The Sellbot Boss is a very busy Cog, so the guard will not allow you to see the Boss unless you have important Cog business, like needing a promotion. You must earn your promotion by fighting Sellbots to collect "merits" around Toontown. Merits are given out after every battle just like Gag experience and are recorded in your Shticker Book as well. The elevator to the top of Cog HQ holds 8 players so when you are ready for your promotion, group up with your friends and head up to battle the Boss.

<p>If you defeat the Sellbot Boss Cog, you will free the hostage Toon who will in turn present you with his "trading card". You can use these cards in battle to call on them for extra assistance in a tough spot. Of course, knowing the Cogs, they will quickly build another Sellbot Boss Cog, so hurry and get your next promotion to rescue another Toon. There are 40 total promotions as you work your way up the corporate ladder.

<h5>Summary of What is New</h5>
<ul>
<li>New Physics with jumping ability - now you can hurdle bushes, jump onto crates, and hop over small fences! 
<li>New Toon interactions - conveyor belts, stompers, gears, locked doors, switches, pushable crates, platform action. 
<li>New Gag, Laff, and Jellybean Barrels - Cogs have stockpiled all the Toon items they have stolen. You can recover them in the factory. 
<li>New Cog Factory environment 
<li>New Cog Boss enemy 
<li>New Pie throwing mode in final phase of Boss Battle 
<li>New Cog HQ environment 
<li>New Rescued Toons (SOS) system (as tested in previous test releases) 
<li>New Rescued Toon Shticker Book page holds up to 8 Toon cards 
<li>New Rescued Toon battle interface 
<li>New Cog Disguise Shticker Book page 
<li>New Cog Merit system with 40 promotion levels 
<li>New "Skelecogs" - Sellbots that do not have their final Cog suit built 
<li>New "Goons" - Cog worker drones 
<li>New street - "Oak Street" off Daisy Gardens playground 
<li>New map artwork 
<li>New Shticker Book tabs make finding pages faster and easier 
</ul>

<p><b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
<li>There is no reward presentation when you finish a factory, but you should still get the Cog disguise part. 
<li>Teleporting to other Toons inside CogHQ will sometimes crash your client. 
<li>You may fall through the floor on fishing docks on the streets of Donald's Dock. 
<li>You will be able to jump over the fences around fishing docks 
<li>If there are textures missing, polygons will show up pure red or white.

<li>Jumping on crates is too difficult. 
<li>Some visual cracks exist on Oak Street 
<li>You can jump over Flippy in the tutorial. 
<li>If you enter the game before finishing the Tutorial download your client will crash. Allow the full download to finish before choosing or creating a Toon. 
<li>Timing of stompers crushing Goons inside Factory warehouse is off. 
<li>Camera control inside Factory warehouse is being worked on. 
<li>Boss battle currently crashes out.  This will be fixed soon!
</ul>

<p>Note: A release date has not been finalized.

</p>

<b>October 30, 2003 [sv1.0.8.0.test]</b>
<p><b>Fishing</b>
<br>New fishing system and interface integrated. Here are the basics:
<ul>
<li>You can now catch fish in the ponds located in every playground and
street in Toontown. As you fish at a pond, your new fishing bucket will fill
up with the fish you catch. When your bucket is full, or if you run out of
Jellybeans, you need to sell the fish to the Pet Shop Clerks located near the
ponds in the Playgrounds. Fish that are heavier and more rare are worth more
Jellybeans. There are 50 total fish species. Some fish have particular ponds
where they live, others can be found in every pond. Your fishing rod can be
upgraded by purchasing stronger rods sold in Clarabelle's Cattlelog (coming
soon). Better rods are stronger and can catch heavier fish, but cost more
Jellybeans to fish with. In this initial test release, everybody will have
the beginner "twig" fishing rod.

<li>Each 10 fish species you collect will earn you a fishing trophy and +1
Laff Boost, bringing the maximum Laff points up to 105. You can keep track of
the fish you have seen and the trophies you have with a new page in your
Shticker Book (temporary artwork).

<li>Fishing ToonTasks should still work as they always have.

<li>We will be releasing final fish models and final Shticker Book interface
over the next few days. Until the final models are finished, the Pool Shark
and Moon Fish are using the Clown Fish model.
</ul>
<p>Please enjoy helping us test this new system and send us comments,
questions, and bugs.

<p><b>SOS Toons</b>
<br>We are testing an early version of SOS Toons. Now, not only can you call
your friends into battle, you can also call shop keepers like Flippy and Li'l
Old Man in for help. Since this feature touches many parts of the battle
system, it needs thorough testing and accurate bug reporting. We will
eventually be integrating this feature into a future release. For testing
purposes everybody will be given free access to these helpers. Just press the
SOS button on the battle menu and play through as many scenarios as you can
think of with your friends.

<p><b>Other Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>New elevator code - no new features, just a new underlying system. Report
anything unusual.
<li>New Toon shadow code. Report anything unusual
<li>Fixed bug where tutorial battle would time-out and cause client crash.

We found a problem where two separate accounts with the same exact name differing
only by capitalization, such as "Flippy" and "flippy", were actually sharing the same
Toons.
<p>
We have created separate accounts for those that had this conflict and have sent an email
to those accounts that were renamed and had an email address entered. Accounts that were
renamed now have a "2" at the end, such as "Flippy2". All passwords remained the same.

We fixed the 35HP limit ToonTask bug and extra gag track choosing ToonTasks. To
do so, we had to revoke some track access and HP that was given out
prematurely. You may find you no longer have access to some gag
tracks given as a result of this bug. <b>Rest assured, your Toon will keep all experience
gained while using that track.</b> You will see this experience reappear when
your Toon has retrained those tracks. A few Toons also lost some ToonTask
progress and will need to pick between Drop and Lure again. We apologize
for this error.
</p>

Your bug reports have been a great help to the development of
Toontown. Thank you for your continued support as we strive to make
Toontown the best game it can be. We expect to send out more
accounts to fan club members once this latest release is stable.

<li>Re-fixed bug that caused crash in certain cases when talking

<p/>

<a name="login"><b>IMPORTANT: Login</b></a>

<p/>

There is a new login procedure. Instead of logging in on the web page,
just click the red "PLAY" button. You will be prompted for a user name
and password once you are in the game. Your old user name (i.e.
toonbeta555) and password will no longer work. Simply create a new
account to play. Feel free to tell your friends and family to create
accounts and play Toontown with you. Toontown is still free of charge
during this beta period.

<p/>

Your old Toons will no longer be in the game. We have started a new
Toon database to support this easier login procedure and to make some
final improvements to the Toontask system. Send email to
<a href="mailto:toontown@disneyonline.com">toontown@disneyonline.com</a> with
your old user name (i.e. toonbeta555) and the name of a newly created
empty account to put your old toons in if you would like to restore
your old Toons stats.

<p/>

<b>Trolley Games</b>
<ul>
<li>Match Minnie has been completed with new artwork, sound effects, and animations. </li><p>

<li>The Tag game has new tag animation and sound effects. </li><p>

<li>The swim game has an easier to use camera mode. </li><p/>

<li>The race game has working chance cards.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Neighborhoods</b>
<ul>

<li>Interactive elements have been added to Minnie's and Daisy's playgrounds. </li><p/>

<li>All streets have names which you will see on the tunnel signs. </li><p/>

<li>Your map shows the street or playground you are currently in. </li><p/>

<li>Many Toon buildings have new names. </li><p/>

<li>Stop by any Toon side door (not the main double doors) for a knock knock joke. </li><p/>

<li>The Toons have moved into their buildings with new furniture and decor. </li><p/>

<li>Many collision surfaces have been fixed so you should get stuck less and pop through fences less.</li><p/>
</ul>

<p/>
<b>Cog Buildings</b>
<ul>
<li>Cog building interiors are now more in tune with the difficulty of the surrounding neighborhood.</li><p/>

<li>You will see fewer cog buildings and a more balanced Cog behavior. </li><p/>

<li>You can tell how many floors are inside Cog buildings and what floor you are on once inside with the new elevator lights just above the doors. </li><p/>

<li>Cog buildings now show the name of the Toon building taken over. </li><p/>

<li>When you defeat a Cog building, your experience gained on each floor is multiplied by the floor level, so as you work your way up you really rack up the experience! </li><p/>

<li>Cogs walk in and out of cog building side doors now and open toon building front doors too.</li><p/>

<li>Many high level Cog attacks have been added. </li><p/>

<li>New sound effects have been inserted into many Cog attacks.</li><p/>
</ul>

<p/>
<b>User Interface</b>

</ul>
<p/>
<b>Gag Experience</b>
<ul>
<li>Your high level gags will no longer give you experience against low level Cogs. The gag detail window will show you when you will not get credit for using a gag in battle. Those gags which will not give you credit will also be a lighter color in your attack panel. You can still use them to defeat the Cogs, but you will not get experience towards the next gag. </li><p/>

<li>Experience gained inside Cog buildings has gone up. Your experience gained on each floor is multiplied by the floor level.</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<b>Whisper Messages</b>
<ul>
<li>Use chat or use the Toontalker to whisper to other Toons without anybody else hearing. You can whisper to anybody on your friends list or any Toon around you by clicking on them and selecting "Whisper" from the Toon detail panel. </li><p/>

<li>You will hear automatic whisper messages whenever a Toon on your friends list enters or leaves Toontown Online.</li><p/>

<li>Creating new accounts is easier and quicker now. Just click the "Create Account" button on the title screen of the game to make a new Toontown account. </li><p/>

<li>Feel free to tell your friends and family to download and create their own account to play too!</li><p/>
</ul>
<p/>

<li>Teleport rewards have been added to the ToonTasks to give access to teleport to the different playgrounds. </li><p/>

<li>There are now tasks to defeat Cog buildings.</li><p/>
</ul>

<b>October 15, 2001</b>
<br/>
What's New In Version 1.0.7
<p/>

Update fixed many known issues and added new
features.  Please see below for details.
<p/>

<b>Graphic Problems</b>
<p/>
If you see a problem with the graphics inside
Toontown Online, in addition to attaching the
log files please do the following BEFORE YOU EXIT:
<OL>
<LI>PRESS the F9 KEY to automatically save a screenshot image in a file named "[frame_number].bmp" which will be saved in "C:\Program Files\Disney\Disney Online\Toontown"</li>
<li>Exit Toontown Online, go to the START MENU, select RUN, and type DXDIAG.EXE</li>
<li>Click SAVE ALL INFORMATION, which saves the file DxDiag.txt, then exit DXDIAG.EXE</li>
<li>Attach the files "DxDiag.txt" and "[frame_number].bmp" to the bug report, along with a description of the problem, and e-mail to toontown@disneyonline.com</li></OL>
<p/>
<b>Under Contruction Areas</b>
<p/>
Signs for neighborhoods that aren't yet available are marked "under construction."
<p/>
<p><b>New Issues</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing Toons may not have all the gags they had prior to this update.  You may also have more gags than are allowed for your Toon (for example, 30/20 gags).  To clear this, die in battle to reset your gag count.  You will then need to complete "ToonTasks" to open these tracks up again.</li>
<p/>
<li>The ability to teleport to other Playgrounds from the map now needs to be earned as a reward, but you can always teleport back to the last Playground you visited, or to any friend.</li>
<p></p>
<li>We have not deleted any existing Toon characters, but we recommend you create a new character on your account to properly test the new ToonTasks.</li>
<p></p>
<li>This update's patches are relatively large because so much new content is included. Future bug-fix type patches should be much smaller in size.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Some ToonTasks require you to defeat certain types of Cogs, such as Money, Corporate, Sales, or Legal -- see What's New for more on this. It is not obvious in the current release which Cogs are which. This will be addressed in a future update.  To help you, Money Cogs have green dollar signs on their outfits, Sales Cogs wear dark plaid, Corporate Cogs wear blue suits, and the Legal Cogs wear brown suits.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Some ToonTasks require you to visit a certain Toon in Toontown. A future release will inform you exactly which building that Toon lives in.  For now, look for word clues, such as finding "Henrietta Hog" in "The Hog Wash."</li>
<p></p>
<li>Although the free chat box is always available, only your "secret friends" will be able to understand what you type -- see What's New for more on this. If you see other Toons barking or meowing, it is because you are not secret friends with them. Use the ToonTalker to tell them to use the ToonTalker.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Another upcoming release should include Trolley Game improvements, new interface artwork, whisper messages, more Cog interiors, new Toon interiors with props, ToonTask improvements, and other enhancements. Please send e-mail to toontown@disneyonline.com with your suggestions and feature requests.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>What's New in Toontown Online version 1.0.6</b></p>
<p></p>
<b>ToonTasks</b>
<p>You can now enter the buildings in the Playgrounds (such as in Toontown Central) to meet new Toons who will give you "ToonTasks"
to fight Cogs, win back buildings, and deliver gags to other
Toons. You get a reward for each ToonTask finished. Each reward will
increase your Laff Meter, allowing you to carry more gags and giving you access to new types of gags, or advancing your Toon in some other
way. You can check the progress of your ToonTasks with a new page in
your Shticker Book.</p>
<p></p>
<b>ToonTalker</b>
<p>More phrases have been added, and the interface has been made easier to use.  Please e-mail toontown@disneyonline.com with any suggestions for other phrases that you might like.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Secret Friends</b>
<p>In order to provide a safe place for kids to play online, the
ToonTalker is still the basic form of communication, but now you can
also make "secret friends" to chat freely with. To make a secret
friend, you must get a secret code from the Friends List.  You may
then tell someone you know that code (for example, you can tell your
friend at school, or you can tell your family members).  When the
other player types in your code, you will then be able to freely chat,
and no one else will be able to see what you are saying. Each secret
code can be used one time, and expires after 48 hours if unused.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Cog Buildings</b>
<p>You can now venture into Cog office buildings and rescue them from Cog domination, thereby saving Toontown! Up to four Toons can hop in a Cog elevator and battle through several floors and to the top. A Cog boss lurks at the top office of every building. Be careful, battles inside buildings are much tougher than out on the street, so stock up on gags, and find some friends to join you!</p>
<p/>
<b>New Trolley Game</b>
<p>A new Trolley Game has been added -- the Ring Game. Swim through all the rings that are your color. If everybody swims through their rings successfully, your group gets bonus jelly beans.</p>
<p></p>
<b>New Cogs and New Cog Attacks</b>
<p>High-level Cogs have been added to increase difficulty in the tougher neighborhoods and inside Cog buildings.  Cogs also now have more attacks.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Population Count</b>
<p>The Shticker Book now shows the "population" for each Toontown District, so that you can see how many people are playing in your District.</p>
<b>Playground Treasure</b>
<p>Treasure chests have been replaced with themed treasures for each Playground.</p>
<b>New Animation</b>
<p>More animation has been added for Toon battles and for Cog and Toon building takeover sequences.</p>
<p><b>Other Changes include:</b> One new street, more signs, and many graphical fixes; Progress Meter improvements for download indicators; more Disney characters in the Playgrounds; ability to see other players' usernames; various performance and memory optimizations.</p>
